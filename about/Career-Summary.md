# Career Summary / Who I Am

I’m someone who gravitates toward clarity, structure, and efficiency. Whether I’m diagnosing a technical issue, organizing information, or building an operational workflow from scratch, my instinct is to create systems that make work easier, faster, and more predictable for the people who use them.

I am completing my **Business Analytics degree at the University of Tennessee** (Haslam College of Business), where I’ve built a strong foundation in **data analysis**, **R**, **SQL**, **Python**, **statistical modeling**, and **structured problem-solving**. My coursework centered on reproducible analysis, dashboard creation, technical documentation, and translating complex outputs into clear, actionable insights.

Alongside my academic work, I spent nearly four years at **Apple**, where I received the **highest level of technical training** in **iOS, macOS, iPadOS, watchOS, and visionOS**. I was trained and certified in **iPhone and Mac hardware repair** and progressed into the **Genius** role, where I specialized in complex technical troubleshooting and Tier 2-level diagnostics.

As a **Genius**, I trained new technicians from the ground up and supported tenured technicians as new procedures and technologies rolled out. I later moved into a **Team Lead** role, serving on the in-store leadership team with direct responsibility for the **Genius Bar’s technical operations, coaching, documentation standards, and daily workflow execution**.

Earlier at Apple, I also served as a **Business Expert**, working with Apple’s internal CRM and device management tools to design solutions for business customers, document workflows, and translate technical requirements into clear guidance for teams and clients.

Before Apple, I worked with **Bumble**, where I progressed from campus ambassador to **Southeast Regional Manager** for the Bumble Honey Program. I oversaw **175+ ambassadors across 45+ campuses**, managing two Community Directors and roughly fifteen of the largest universities in the region. In partnership with Bumble HQ, I used **Slack**, **Airtable**, **Google Workspace**, and other operational tools to coordinate national program execution, maintain documentation, streamline communication, and ensure consistency across a distributed team. This experience strengthened my skills in **program management, systematizing processes, documentation, and cross-team communication**.

Outside of school and work, I founded **Knoxville Movement Collective** (https://knoxvillemovement.com), an outdoor community that has grown to **350+ members** and **100+ events** in its first six months. Building KMC required creating **every operational system from scratch**: onboarding workflows, scheduling processes, communication templates, safety escalation procedures, volunteer documentation, and scalable event processes. It gave me practical experience designing systems that reduce ambiguity, anticipate edge cases, and scale as participation grows.

Across all of these experiences, the theme is consistent: I take something messy or ambiguous and make it make sense. I enjoy breaking down problems, understanding how pieces fit together, and creating **workflows, documentation, tools, and analytical structures** that help people move forward with clarity.

I am drawn to roles focused on **technical analysis**, **documentation**, **workflow design**, and **operational problem solving** because they align naturally with how I think. I like supporting users, improving processes, and building systems that help teams operate more efficiently. This portfolio reflects that approach through real operational work, structured technical scenarios, and examples of how I design and document the systems that make organizations run more smoothly.
