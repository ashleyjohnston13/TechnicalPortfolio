# Career Summary / Who I Am

I’m someone who gravitates toward clarity, structure, and efficiency. Whether I’m diagnosing a technical issue, organizing information, or building an operational workflow from scratch, my instinct is to create systems that make work easier, faster, and more predictable for the people who rely on them.

I am completing my **Business Analytics degree at the University of Tennessee** (Haslam College of Business), where I’ve built a strong foundation in **data analysis**, **R**, **SQL**, **Python**, **statistical modeling**, and **structured problem-solving**. My academic work focused on reproducible analysis, dashboarding, technical documentation, and translating technical output into clear insights.

Alongside school, I spent nearly four years at **Apple**, where I received the **highest level of technical training** in **iOS, macOS, iPadOS, watchOS, and visionOS**. I became certified in **iPhone and Mac hardware repair** and progressed into the **Genius** role, handling complex diagnostics and escalations. I trained new technicians, coached tenured ones on new procedures, and later moved into a **Team Lead** position supporting the Genius Bar’s operations, documentation consistency, and technical standards.

Earlier at Apple, I served as a **Business Expert**, working with Apple’s internal CRM tools to design solutions for business clients, document workflows, and improve how teams communicated technical information. This strengthened my ability to translate technical requirements into clear, actionable guidance.

Before Apple, I worked with **Bumble**, progressing from campus ambassador to **Southeast Regional Manager** for the Bumble Honey Program. I oversaw **175+ ambassadors across 45+ campuses**, including two Community Directors and approximately fifteen of the largest universities in the region. I worked closely with Bumble HQ using tools like **Slack**, **Airtable**, and **Google Workspace** to coordinate national operations, maintain documentation, and streamline communications across a large distributed team. This experience strengthened my skills in **program management, systems organization, large-scale coordination, and structured communication**.

Outside of school and work, I founded **Knoxville Movement Collective**, a **501(c)(3) public charity** focused on increasing access to outdoor movement and community connection. KMC has grown to **350+ members**, **100+ free events**, and **1,300+ social followers** in under six months, with structured programs across running, biking, hiking, paddling, and fitness.

Launching KMC required designing every operational system from the ground up: **onboarding workflows, scheduling processes, safety and incident reporting structures, cross-team communication systems, documentation libraries, coaching playbooks, and volunteer procedures**. Leading a nonprofit taught me how to build scalable systems, anticipate edge cases, create clarity for diverse teams, and maintain operational consistency as the organization grows.

Across all of my work—Apple, Bumble, UTK, and KMC—the theme is consistent: I take something messy or ambiguous and make it make sense. I enjoy breaking down problems, understanding how components fit together, and creating **workflows, documentation, and structures** that help people move forward with clarity.

I’m drawn to roles focused on **technical analysis**, **documentation**, **workflow design**, and **operational problem solving** because they align naturally with how I think. I like supporting users, improving processes, and building systems that help teams operate more efficiently. This portfolio reflects that approach through real operational work, structured technical scenarios, and examples of how I design and document the systems that make organizations run smoothly.
