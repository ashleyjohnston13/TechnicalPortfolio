## 📊 Project Overview

The goal of this project was to build a classification model using the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic Dataset**.  
A Random Forest classifier was selected due to its strong performance and interpretability.

The workflow includes:

- Loading and inspecting the dataset  
- Scaling numeric features  
- Training a Random Forest model  
- Generating predictions and evaluation metrics  
- Creating performance visualizations  
- Analyzing feature importance
