# Random Forest Classification in Python  
### Predicting Breast Cancer Diagnosis Using scikit-learn

This project demonstrates a complete machine learning workflow using Python and scikit-learn.  
It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visual interpretation of results.

This project is part of my analytics portfolio and highlights my ability to build reproducible, well-documented machine learning pipelines.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project was to build a classification model using the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic Dataset**.  
A Random Forest classifier was selected due to its strong performance and interpretability.

The workflow includes:

- Loading and inspecting the dataset  
- Scaling numeric features  
- Training a Random Forest model  
- Generating predictions and evaluation metrics  
- Creating performance visualizations  
- Analyzing feature importance

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.13  
- pandas  
- numpy  
- matplotlib  
- scikit-learn  

---

## Model Performance

The model achieved strong performance:

- **Accuracy:** ~0.95  
- Excellent precision & recall for both classes  
- High AUC on the ROC curve
