# 🏃‍♀️ Physical Inactivity & Socioeconomic Drivers in Tennessee  
**ECON 381 — Applied Econometrics Project | Economics Collateral, Business Analytics B.S., University of Tennessee**

This project was completed as part of my *Economics collateral* within the Business Analytics program at UTK.  
It investigates the socioeconomic and environmental determinants of physical inactivity across Tennessee counties using:

- 📊 Regression modeling in **Stata**  
- 🎨 Visual analytics in **Tableau**  
- 🏛 Data from the **2025 County Health Rankings**

This dashboard complements my full econometric paper, where I estimated predictors of physical inactivity using multiple regression.

## 📊 Key Visualizations

---

## 1️⃣ **Access to Exercise vs Physical Inactivity**  
Counties with more exercise access tend to have slightly lower inactivity, but the relationship is weak.

---

## 2️⃣ **Median Household Income vs Physical Inactivity**  
Higher-income counties consistently have lower physical inactivity, showing a strong negative relationship.

## 3️⃣ **Physical Inactivity by County (Choropleth Map)**  
A geographic breakdown of physical inactivity across Tennessee.

- 🌟 **Lowest:** Williamson County — *17.1%*  
- ⚠️ **Highest:** Hancock County — *37.2%*

## 📘 Summary of Findings  

Regression model estimated in Stata:

```text
PhysicalInactivity_i = β0 
    + β1 * AccessExercise_i 
    + β2 * Income_i 
    + β3 * Education_i 
    + β4 * Unemployment_i 
    + β5 * Age65Plus_i 
    + β6 * Population_i 
    + ε_i
```

### 🔍 Key Results  
- **Access to Exercise:** Not statistically significant  
- **Income:** Strongest negative predictor of inactivity  
- **Education:** Higher education correlates with lower inactivity  
- **Unemployment:** Positive association with inactivity  
- **Population:** Slightly negative relationship  
- **Age 65+:** Mild negative effect  

# 📝 Interpretation  

Socioeconomic factors — especially income and education — drive the majority of variation in physical inactivity across Tennessee counties.  
Access to exercise facilities, while intuitively important, does **not** show a statistically significant effect once controlling for income and regional demographics.

This suggests that addressing **structural economic inequalities** may be more effective than focusing solely on physical infrastructure.

# 📂 Data Availability  

⚠️ **Important:**  
The dataset used in this project comes from restricted ECON 381 course materials and the 2025 County Health Rankings.  
Because it is educational and proprietary, **the raw data cannot be published online**.

This README provides all allowable outputs: findings, code structure, and visualizations.
