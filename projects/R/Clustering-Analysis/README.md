# Clustering Analysis in R  
### K-Means + Hierarchical Clustering

This project demonstrates unsupervised learning techniques using R. I performed both k-means and hierarchical clustering to identify natural groupings in an example dataset and visualize the structure of those clusters.

This assignment reflects work completed in my Business Analytics coursework at the University of Tennessee, where we practiced clustering, scaling, interpreting outputs, and choosing an appropriate number of clusters.

## 🎯 Purpose

This project highlights my experience with:

- Unsupervised learning  
- K-means clustering  
- Hierarchical clustering (complete + average linkage)  
- Data scaling and distance calculations  
- Elbow and silhouette interpretation  
- Visualizing clusters using base R and ggplot2  
- Explaining results in a clear, business-focused way

## 📊 Methods Used

### **1. Data Preparation**
- Used built-in `USArrests` dataset  
- Scaled variables  
- Checked for outliers and variable symmetry  

### **2. K-Means Clustering**
- Tested multiple k values  
- Generated elbow plot  
- Interpreted centers and cluster meaning  

### **3. Hierarchical Clustering**
- Calculated distance matrix  
- Produced dendrogram using complete linkage  
- Compared results to k-means
