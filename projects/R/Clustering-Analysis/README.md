# Clustering Analysis in R  
### K-Means + Hierarchical Clustering

This project demonstrates unsupervised learning techniques using R. I performed both k-means and hierarchical clustering to identify natural groupings in a dataset and visualize the structure of those clusters.

This assignment reflects work completed in my Business Analytics coursework at the University of Tennessee, where we practiced clustering, scaling, interpreting outputs, and choosing an appropriate number of clusters.

## 🎯 Purpose

This project highlights my experience with:

- Data preprocessing and scaling  
- K-means clustering  
- Hierarchical clustering (complete linkage)  
- PCA visualization  
- Interpreting and comparing cluster structures  
- Communicating findings through visuals
