# Movie Recommendation App (R Shiny)

This project is an interactive movie recommendation tool built in R using the Shiny framework. The app allows users to select movies they enjoy and receive personalized recommendations generated from association rules.

This was the final Shiny application I built for my Business Analytics Capstone course (BAS 479) at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. The goal was to design a clean, intuitive interface that demonstrates how data-driven recommendations can be made using real-world techniques like market basket analysis.

## Purpose

This project highlights my experience with:

- R programming and reactive Shiny components  
- Association rule mining (arules package)  
- Building clean, user-friendly interfaces  
- Structuring a complete recommendation workflow  
- Deploying interactive analytics tools  
- Applying classroom concepts to a functioning, real-world-style application  

It reflects how I approach technical problems: break them down, simplify the experience, and build a clear system around the logic.
