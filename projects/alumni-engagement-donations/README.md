## 📈 Key Dashboards & Insights

### 🟧 1. Donation Rate by Alumni Event Participation  
Alumni who attend more engagement events show dramatically higher donation rates.

![Donation Rate by Events](Dashboard-Images/events_donation_rate.png)

**Insight:**  
- 5+ events → ~83% donation rate  
- No events → ~10% donation rate  
- Event engagement is one of the strongest predictors of giving.

---

### 🏈 2. Donation Rate by Football Game Attendance  
Long-term athletics involvement strongly correlates with donor loyalty.

![Donation Rate by Games](Dashboard-Images/games_donation_rate.png)

**Insight:**  
- 50+ games attended → ~82% donation rate  
- No games attended → ~9%  
- Athletic affinity is a high-value donor segment.

---

### 📅 3. Donation Rate by Number of Prior Giving Years  
Giving history is the **strongest predictor** of future giving.

![Prior Years Giving](Dashboard-Images/prior_years_donation_rate.png)

**Insight:**  
- Donation rates rise consistently with historical giving  
- 6+ years of giving → 73%–94% likelihood to donate  
- Past giving behavior provides the clearest signal of donor commitment.

---

### 💵 4. Donation Rate by Total Cash Given (Last 10 Years)  
Lifetime giving demonstrates a strong positive relationship with continued donations.

![Lifetime Giving](Dashboard-Images/lifetime_cash_donation_rate.png)

**Insight:**  
- $501+ lifetime giving → ~64% donation rate  
- $10 or less → ~12%  
- Total cash given helps identify high-capacity donor groups.

---

## 🔍 Summary of Actionable Findings

### 1. Engagement is a leading indicator of donation likelihood  
More events = more loyalty.

### 2. Athletic affinity signals long-term connection  
Football game attendance is a valuable segmentation attribute.

### 3. Prior giving history predicts future contributions  
Consistent donors almost always return.

### 4. Combining behavioral + financial indicators improves targeting  
Advancement teams can more effectively:  
- Identify high-propensity donors  
- Personalize communication  
- Prioritize outreach  
- Improve conversion and retention rates
