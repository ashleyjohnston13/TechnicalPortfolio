# 🎓 Alumni Donation Behavior Analysis  
**BAS 479 Business Analytics Capstone – University of Tennessee, Knoxville**

This project analyzes key behavioral drivers of alumni donation likelihood using engagement, giving history, and event participation patterns. The goal is to help Advancement teams understand which touchpoints most strongly predict future giving.

# 📊 Key Insights & Visualizations

All insights below are derived from Tableau dashboards I created for this project.  
Each visualization is based on aggregated, de-identified metrics allowed for public display.

## 🟧 Donation Rate by Alumni Event Participation  
Alumni who stay actively engaged through events are **far more likely** to give again.

![Donation Rate by Alumni Event Participation](Plots/event_participation.png)

**Insight:**  
Attending **5+ events** increases donation likelihood to **83 percent**, compared to only **9.8 percent** for alumni with no event participation.  
Event involvement is one of the strongest behavioral indicators of donor conversion.

## 🏈 Donation Rate by Football Game Attendance  
Long-term sports engagement is a powerful predictor of giving.

![Donation Rate by Football Game Attendance](Plots/football_attendance.png)

**Insight:**  
Alumni who have attended **50 or more games** donate at **82.3 percent**, dramatically higher than alumni with no game attendance (**9.6 percent**).  
Lifelong affinity strongly correlates with philanthropic behavior.

---

## 📈 Donation Rate by Number of Prior Giving Years  
Giving is a habitual behavior — each repeated year of giving increases the odds of giving again.

![Donation Rate by Number of Prior Giving Years](Plots/prior_giving_years.png)

**Insight:**  
Donation likelihood sharply increases after **6+ prior giving years**, reaching **94.4 percent** for donors with nine years of giving history.  
Retention and consistent stewardship matter significantly more than one-time campaigns.

## 💵 Donation Rate by Total Cash Given (Last 10 Years)  
Lifetime cash giving is one of the strongest indicators of donor commitment.

![Donation Rate by Total Cash Given](Plots/total_cash_given.png)

**Insight:**  
Alumni who have given **$501+ in the last decade** donate again at **63.7 percent**, compared to only **2.5 percent** of alumni with no giving history.  
Cumulative giving is a highly predictive engagement metric.
