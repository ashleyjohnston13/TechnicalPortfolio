# Why I Built This Portfolio

I am drawn to roles where I can:

- organize complex processes  
- create clarity in documentation  
- solve operational problems  
- build workflows and systems that support teams  
- communicate clearly with both technical and non-technical users  

My background across Apple, UTK, and Knoxville Movement Collective reflects a combination of customer support, systems design, process creation, and technical communication. This portfolio is designed to show those skills through real work and structured examples.
